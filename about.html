<!-- shri got his start with music at 9 years of age, learning to play the violin.-->
<!--                    unfortunately, even though he played the violin regularly for 7 years &#45;&#45; this doesn't turn into the story of a prominent violinist.-->
<!--                    shri was lazy and didn't put enough into the violin, probably because he wanted to play a 'cool' instrument, like the guitar or drums.-->

<!--                    <img src="img/shri_tower.jpg" class="square" />-->

<!--                    fast forward years later, shri moved to san francisco where he experienced his first parties, clubs, and festivals.-->
<!--                    he fell in love with the people, the environment, and most importantly <i>the music</i>.-->

<!--                    <img src="img/shri_events.jpg" class="square" />-->

<!--                    wanting to give back to his community, he decided to start throwing events.-->
<!--                    with his events, he created a unique, playful, warm, child-like atmosphere.-->
<!--                    having a carefully curated group in costume and interactive experiences, his events were quite successful.-->
<!--                    through these events, he met his dear friend Dmitry who first taught shri how to spin.-->
<!--                    <img src="img/shri_dmitry.jpg" class="square" />-->

<!--                    after his first lesson with Dmitry, shri started spending all of his free time curating his library and practicing DJing.-->
<!--                    he started hosting more music-geared events and taking every opportunity he could to practice his skills in front of a crowd. -->
